### Directory Overview

1. **`src/` Directory**
   - **Purpose:** Contains the main source code of the application.
   - **Subdirectories:**
     - **`pkg`:** Houses abstract classes and interfaces, focusing on core components and their interactions.

2. **`contrib/` Directory**
   - **Purpose:** Provides additional scripts and configurations to support development and deployment.
   - **Contents:**
     - **Dockerfiles:** Used for building Docker images, enabling containerization for various environments (e.g., `pytest.Dockerfile`, `base.Dockerfile`, `app.Dockerfile`).
     - **Scripts:** Includes scripts for managing databases and other infrastructure aspects (e.g., `db.sh`).

3. **`docker-compose.yml`**
   - **Purpose:** Defines services, networks, and volumes for Docker containers, facilitating multi-container Docker applications.

4. **`.env` and `container.env`**
   - **Purpose:** Store environment variables for configuration, ensuring sensitive information is managed securely.

### Architectural Overview

The architecture of this project appears to be modular and service-oriented, leveraging design patterns that emphasize reusability and maintainability. Key architectural components include:

- **Modularity:** The use of abstract classes and interfaces in the `pkg` directory suggests a design that promotes modularity, allowing components to be easily extended or replaced.
- **Configuration Management:** The `config` directory and environment files (`.env`, `container.env`) highlight a focus on flexible configuration management, allowing the application to adapt to different environments and requirements.
- **Database Interaction:** The `driver` directory suggests a structured approach to database interactions, with support for multiple database systems.
